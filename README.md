This is a Telegram Bot written in Java. It offers a temperature query feature which uses <https://www.weatherapi.com/> to fetch data. It also features a basic To-Do-List. A log file is included and a database that manages all tasks. First initialization of the db can take a 
few seconds.
Requires an API-Key from Telegram named "TELEGRAM_API_KEY" and a <https://www.weatherapi.com/> API-Key named "WEATHER_API_KEY" as enviromental variables.<br>
On Windows in a commandline: `set TELEGRAM_API_KEY={your_key}`
Then you can run the jar with: `java -jar UtilityBot_version.jar`
